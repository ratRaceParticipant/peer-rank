# Peer Rank

**Peer Rank** this is where grudges live and thrive. Designed for those who believe in accountability and never letting go, Peer Rank lets you channel your frustrations and critiques into a structured rating system. Never forgive, never forget—track every interaction, every shortcoming, and take your hate towards people to the next level by evaluating them with brutal honesty.

## Features

### 1. Instance-Based Peer Rating
- Users can rate their peers on specific tasks, interactions, or contributions. Each rating is tied to an **instance**, providing context to feedback and ensuring it’s directly related to real experiences.

### 2. Rating Calculation
- The app calculates an overall **peer rating** by averaging scores from multiple instances. This offers a fair and data-backed evaluation over time.
  
### 3. Rating Trend Charts
- A chart-based visualization feature displays individual **rating trends**. This allows users to monitor a peer’s performance and progress over time, providing insights into strengths and areas for improvement.

### 4. Face ID Authentication
- For security, **Peer Rank** integrates **Face ID authentication**, ensuring that only authorized users can access and view peer profiles or submit ratings.

## How It Works

1. **Add a Peer**: Users can add their peers to the app.
2. **Create an Instance**: When rating a peer, users create an **instance** linked to a specific interaction. This provides context for the feedback.
3. **Submit Ratings**: Based on customizable criteria (e.g., communication, collaboration, problem-solving), users submit ratings for peers within each instance.
4. **Face ID Authentication**: Before accessing peer profiles or submitting ratings, users must pass **Face ID** verification.
5. **View Ratings & Trends**: Once enough instances are collected, the app aggregates ratings and displays a **rating trend chart**, showing how the peer’s performance has evolved.

## Installation

To install and run **Peer Rank**, follow these steps:

**Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ratRaceParticpant/peer-rank.git
    ```

5. **Face ID Setup** (Optional):
    - If using Face ID authentication, ensure that Face ID is set up on the user's device before launching the app.

## Usage

1. **Log In**: Authenticate via Face ID to access the app’s functionalities.
2. **Add Peers**: Begin by adding peers to your workspace or team.
3. **Create Instances**: After interactions or tasks, create instances and rate your peers accordingly.
4. **View Trend Charts**: Analyze rating trends to track individual performance over time.
